 Simple Card RPG
====================

Simple Card RPG is supposed to be a simplistic card-based tabletop roleplaying game.
Instead of sheaves of paper and huge reference texts, all players have are their cards.
For each equipment slot, they can have one item; for each ability slot, they can have one ability.

 Getting Started
------------------

Use the built-in make.sh script to generate the JSON card data, then the latex source files, then pdfs of the cards.

 Making Your Own
------------------

Look in adventurequest_cards.py for an example of how to use the card generator.
